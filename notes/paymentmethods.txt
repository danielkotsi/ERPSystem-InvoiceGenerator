Payment Methods in myDATA Invoices — Explanation

The paymentMethods section in a myDATA invoice describes how the invoice is or will be paid.
It is an optional field for most invoice types.

Invoices can be issued whether or not payment has already happened.
Therefore, paymentMethods does not automatically mean the buyer has actually paid — it only records the method or expected method of payment.

When it is used

To indicate immediate payment (e.g., cash, POS, bank transfer).

To show expected payment method for credit invoices.

To record partial or multiple payments.

To support ERP accounting, reconciliation, and audits.

When it is not required

When the invoice is issued but not yet paid.

For typical B2B invoices where payment will occur later.

When the business does not track payments inside the invoice document.

Example use cases

Immediate payment: A plumber issues an invoice and is paid on the spot.
→ Include paymentMethods with the actual payment.

Delayed payment: A B2B invoice will be paid next month.
→ Leave paymentMethods empty or describe the intended payment method.

Mixed payments: Part cash, part POS.
→ Add multiple entries with different types and amounts.

Key point

Invoices do not require payment to exist.
The payment does not “follow” the invoice the way it does for a retail receipt.

The paymentMethods section is simply a structured way to describe payment behavior if you choose to include it.
